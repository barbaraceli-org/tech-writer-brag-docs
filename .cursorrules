# Tech Writer Brag Docs

Generate a single brag-doc report for technical writers. Follow ALL instructions. Return only the final Markdown report; save to `reports/` and confirm when done.

**Core requirements:**
- One report per request; structure and length depend on cadence (daily, weekly, monthly, quarter, semester).
- Use active, outcome-focused language (e.g. "Shipped…", "Unblocked…", "Reduced…"). Evidence-based, no fluff.
- Link to Jira keys (e.g. EDU-123) and PR numbers (e.g. PR #456) where applicable.

## 0. Connection validation (mandatory first step)

Before any data retrieval or report generation:

1. Call `mcp_Atlassian-MCP-Server_getAccessibleAtlassianResources`.
2. If it fails or errors: STOP. Do not fetch Jira/GitHub or generate a report. Tell the user: "Unable to connect to Jira. Please check your Atlassian MCP connection. See `docs/SETUP.md`."
3. If it succeeds: continue to section 1.

## 1. Inputs and data retrieval

**User provides:** Cadence and period (and optionally extra context not in Jira/GitHub).

**Cadence and date range:**
- **Daily:** Single day (e.g. "yesterday", "2026-02-09"). Output: 3–5 bullets.
- **Weekly:** Calendar week (e.g. "last week", "2026-W06"). Output: 5–10 bullets, optional by theme.
- **Biweekly:** Two-week period (e.g. "last 2 weeks", "2026-02-09 to 2026-02-22"). Output: 5–10 bullets with sections.
- **Monthly:** Calendar month (e.g. "February 2026", "2026-02"). Output: sections by work area, key metrics.
- **Quarter:** Q1–Q4 (e.g. "Q1 2026"). Output: accomplishments by area + metrics.
- **Semester:** H1 (Jan–Jun) or H2 (Jul–Dec) (e.g. "H1 2026"). Same as quarter but broader.

Resolve relative terms ("last week", "this month") to concrete YYYY-MM-DD using the current date when the user asks.

**Jira (Atlassian MCP):**
- Get Cloud ID: `mcp_Atlassian-MCP-Server_getAccessibleAtlassianResources`.
- Search: `mcp_Atlassian-MCP-Server_searchJiraIssuesUsingJql`.
- JQL (adapt YYYY-MM-DD to the period):  
  `assignee = currentUser() AND NOT (summary ~ "LOC REVIEW" OR summary ~ "LOC") AND NOT issuetype = "Epic" AND (resolutiondate >= "START" AND resolutiondate <= "END" OR (status CHANGED TO "In Progress" DURING ("START", "END") OR status WAS "In Progress" ON "END")) ORDER BY updated DESC`
- Include both completed (resolutiondate in range) and in-progress (worked on during range). Fields: summary, status, issuetype, priority, created, updated, resolutiondate, labels, components.

**GitHub (if MCP available):**
- PRs authored: `mcp_github_search_pull_requests` with `author:@me created:START..END`.
- PRs reviewed: `mcp_github_search_pull_requests` with `reviewed-by:@me created:START..END`.
- Prefer docs-related files: `*.md`, `**/docs/**`, `README*`, `CONTRIBUTING*`.

**Processing:**
- Group by work area (components → labels → project/repo). For daily/weekly, grouping is optional.
- Include any extra activities the user mentioned (presentations, mentoring, process improvements, etc.).

## 3. Writing rules

- Tone: Confident, active, outcome-focused. No flattery or filler.
- One sentence per bullet; 3–10 bullets per section depending on cadence.
- Always include Jira keys and PR numbers where applicable.
- Valid Markdown; no placeholders or empty sections.
- Save the report under `reports/` with the correct filename and tell the user it’s done.

**Priority:** Accurate reflection of work, clarity, and usefulness for 1:1s and status updates.
